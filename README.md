Fraud Detection Application

A Python Streamlit web app that detects fraudulent transactions using a machine learning model built with scikit-learn. The application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input transaction details and get predictions in real time.

🚀 Features

Interactive Streamlit UI for fraud detection

Machine learning model trained with scikit-learn

Real-time prediction on new transactions

Data preprocessing & feature scaling

Visualization of transaction statistics and model performance
🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Streamlit (for web interface)

scikit-learn (for model building)

pandas, numpy (for data handling)

matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

📊 Model Training

The model was trained using scikit-learn classifiers such as Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost (mention the one you used).

Data preprocessing includes:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler)

Train-test split

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

📌 Future Improvements

Deploy app using Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS

Add real-time transaction streaming support

Improve accuracy with ensemble methods

Implement explainable AI (SHAP/LIME) for model interpretability
